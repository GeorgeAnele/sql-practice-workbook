# SQL Practice Workbook (MSSQL)

This is my first repository on github and all the codes were written by me and they are for educational purposes.
This repository contains a **SQL Practice Workbook** designed to help learners and junior data engineers practice **DDL, DML, and DQL** queries in Microsoft SQL Server.

---

##  Project Structure
- **SQL_Practice_Workbook.sql** → Contains:
  - Database creation (`CompanyDB`)
  - Tables: `Employees`, `Departments`
  - Sample dataset
  - Practice questions with solved SQL queries

- **README.md** → Documentation and usage instructions

---

##  Concepts Covered
1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**  
   - `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**  
   - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

3. **DQL (Data Query Language)**  
   - `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`

---

##  How to Use
1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.  
2. Copy the contents of `SQL_Practice_Workbook.sql`.  
3. Run the script step by step.  
4. Observe results and modify queries for deeper learning.

##  Example Questions
- *DDL:* Add a new column to a table  
- *DML:* Update salary of a specific employee  
- *DQL:* Count employees in each department  
- *JOIN:* List employees with department locations  

Each question is followed by the correct SQL solution.
